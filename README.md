# fils
This is a repository containing a set of tiny libraries, utilities and wrappers which we use for our studio's web & [THREEjs](https://threejs.org) based work.

The libraries are written in TypeScript and all of them are available as individual NPM packages. Some of them are built on top of [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) and may have other dependencies.

It might remain undocumented for a long while but feel free to try it out!

[fil](https://fil.studio) is a studio with a creative tech soul. We build bespoke interactive journeys primarily using modern web technologies. We deliver tailored solutions for installations and on-line experiences using our internal toolkit + [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org).

fil is the Catalan word for thread. We love threads cause we often talk about them when building applications and, at the same time, threads are something so organic, colourful and playful.
