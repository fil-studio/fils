# @fils/gl-dom

This package defines the API interface for WebGL layers in website applications. It contains the abstract `gl` API + [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org) implementations.

It is open to include other apis like [regl](http://regl.party/) in the future or perhaps our own lightweight WebGl vanilla implementation for simple stuff like quad fragment shaders one day.

[fil](https://fil.studio) is a studio with a creative tech soul. We build bespoke interactive journeys primarily using modern web technologies. We deliver tailored solutions for installations and on-line experiences using our internal toolkit + [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org).

fil is the Catalan word for thread. We love threads cause we often talk about them when building applications and, at the same time, threads are something so organic, colourful and playful.
